ATTENTION!!!: Order of declared variable is VERY IMPORTANT. Can work strange only if some variable are comment and would not fit anymore (for example variable of 1 byte near other variabiles). It may be other reaosn...
ATTENTION!!! When external variabiles are used to have same declaration. If one is uint8_t and one uint32_t it may consider uint8_t and did not work as it should
